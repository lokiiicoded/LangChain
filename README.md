# LangChain 🚀  

A complete resource for learning, building, and experimenting with **LangChain** – the open-source framework for developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  

---

## 📌 What is LangChain?  

**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of **LLM-powered applications**.  
It provides a **modular, flexible interface** for working with language models, embedding models, vector stores, and external tools.  
Developers can chain these components into workflows for **chatbots, RAG systems, AI agents, and more**.  

- 🔹 Available in **Python** and **JavaScript**  
- 🔹 Supports **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, IBM watsonx, Hugging Face, and more**  
- 🔹 Used widely in **research, enterprise, and production AI systems**

## ⚡ Key Features  

- **Modular Chains** → Combine models, tools, and logic into pipelines  
- **Prompt Templates** → Standardize and optimize prompt engineering  
- **Tool Integration** → Connect LLMs with APIs, search engines, databases, etc.  
- **AI Agents** → Build autonomous, multi-step reasoning agents  
- **Vector Store Integration** → Works with Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS, IBM Db2, and others  
- **Observability & Deployment** → Tools like LangServe, LangSmith, and LangGraph make it production-ready

## 📜 Origins & Timeline  

- **Oct 2022** → Created by *Harrison Chase* as an open-source project  
- **Apr 2023** → Incorporated as a startup, raised $30M funding  
- **Mid–2023** → Introduced **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**  
- **Oct 2023** → Released **LangServe** for deploying LangChain apps as APIs  
- **Feb 2024** → Launched **LangSmith** for observability & raised $25M (Series A)  
- **May 2025** → Released **LangGraph Platform** for managing stateful AI agents  
- **Jul 2025** → IBM introduced **Db2 LangChain Connector** for enterprise vector search

## 🎯 Use Cases  

LangChain is widely used for:  

- 🤖 **Chatbots** → Context-aware conversational agents  
- 📚 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** → Enriching model responses with real-time data  
- 🧠 **Autonomous AI Agents** → Reasoning systems that use tools & APIs  
- 📄 **Document Summarization & Q&A** → Extracting insights from large datasets  
- 🔍 **Enterprise Search** → Semantic search over structured/unstructured data  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations  

- **Abstraction vs. Control** → Higher-level abstractions may reduce low-level flexibility  
- **Security Risks** → Susceptible to *prompt-to-SQL injection* without safeguards  
- **Complexity** → Advanced pipelines may require careful design for scalability
